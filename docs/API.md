# Getting Started

Botlhale AI's APIs are organised around REST. Our APIs have predictable resource-oriented URLs; 
accept form-encoded request bodies; return JSON-encoded responses; and use standard HTTP 
response codes and authentication. See the Response Codes and Authentication sections of this 
documentation for additional information.

## Supported Languages

The following table shows the languages Botlhale AI currently supports. The table also indicates the 
speech tasks supported for each language. Our team is always working to add new languages to the list.

## Authentication

The Botlhale AI APIs use API keys to authenticate requests. Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them 
secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-facing code, and so on.

Authentication to all API endpoints is performed via Bearer Authentication. Bearer Authentication (also called token 
authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that makes use of security tokens called "bearer tokens". Bearer 
Authentication can be understood as "giving access to the bearer of this token". The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually 
generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when 
making requests to protected resources.

To perform Bearer Authentication, you need to use the REFRESH_TOKEN made available to you upon sign-up. This refreshToken 
does not expire and is used to generate the API key you will use to interact with the API endpoints.

`Authorization: Bearer <IdToken>`


:::tip
You can get your API keys by going navigating to **Profile > API** on the platform.
:::


:::warning
All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests
without authentication will also fail.

**Generate a Bearer Token POST**

`Authorization: Bearer <IdToken>`



This endpoint generates a bearer auth token for secure access to our APIs.

Request Params |Data Type | | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| REFRESH_TOKEN  | `String`  | **Required** | Refresh token used to generate a new authentication token.|


**Request Example**

|Request Params | Data Type | |Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

headers = {}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload, files=files)

print(response.text)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
var formdata = new FormData();
formdata.append("REFRESH_TOKEN", REFRESH_TOKEN);

var requestOptions = {
method: 'POST',
body: formdata,
redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.botlhale.xyz/generateAuthToken", requestOptions)
.then(response => response.text())
.then(result => console.log(result))
.catch(error => console.log('error', error));   
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="NodeJs - Request">

```js
var request = require('request');
var options = {
  'method': 'POST',
  'url': 'https://api.botlhale.xyz/generateAuthToken',
  'headers': {

  },
  formData: {
    'REFRESH_TOKEN': '<IdToken>'
  }
};
request(options, function (error, response) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);
  console.log(response.body);
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js2" label="cURL">

```js
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.botlhale.io/generateAuthToken' \
--form 'REFRESH_TOKEN=<REFRESH_TOKEN>'
```

 </TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Response body
```json
{
    "AuthenticationResult": {
        "AccessToken": "<AccessToken>",
        "ExpiresIn": 86400,
        "IdToken": "<IdToken>",
        "TokenType": "Bearer"
    },
    "ChallengeParameters": {}
}
```


**API Authentication**

Include IdToken as the Bearer Token in headers for Authorization on other API endpoints. All API endpoints 
require a Bearer Token in the header. For example:

`headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <IdToken>"}`


## Response Codes


Botlhale AI uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general:
- Codes in the 2xx range indicate success
- Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error stemming from the information provided (for example, a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, and so on)
- Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error stemming from Botlhale's servers (these are rare)

Successfully executed operations return 2xx codes, and, where appropriate, they return the requested information 
directly in the response body. The following table shows the typical response codes, entities and headers used for 
the various HTTP verbs supported by the APIs.


|HTTP Status Code Summary | Description
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `200 - OK` | Everything worked as expected.| 


As previously mentioned, unsuccessfully executed operations return either a 4xx or 5xx response code. In the case where a 
standard HTTP error is sufficiently descriptive, for example, 401 (Not Authorized), or 404 (Not Found), the response body 
remains empty. In other cases, we use a generic response code for input errors (400), and the response body includes an error 
entity with additional details on the error, including an application error code and a human readable error description. The 
format of this error entity is shown in the following table.


| HTTP Status Code Summary | Description
| ------------- | ------------| 
| `400 - Unauthorized` | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.| 
| `401 - Unauthorized` | No valid API key provided.| 
| `402 - Request Failed` | The parameters were valid but the request failed.| 
| `403 - Forbidden` | The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.| 
| `404 - Not Found` | The requested resource doesn't exist.| 
| `409 - Conflict` | The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key).| 
| `429 - Too Many Requests` | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.| 
| `500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors` | Something went wrong on Botlhale's end (these are rare).
